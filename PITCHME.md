## 1 Using Julia
There are at least 4 ways of using Julia
- Interactive session (i.e., REPL)
    * fast, simple
    * not particularly featureful

+++
- Atom text editor with Juno plug-ins
    * plot window  
    * workspace viewer
    * more like an IDE     

+++
- Running scripts as "executables"
    * Useful for log-running jobs
    * Also advantages for reproducibility

+++
- Using Julia kernel in Jupyter
    * Nice integrated workbook view
    * In line plots
    * Support for Markdown and LaTeX
    * All the advantages of Jupyter

## 2 Vectors (1-D `Array`s)
- All of these are native to Julia
- Behave much like their counterparts in Python (NumPy), R, and Matlab

---
### 2.1 Vectors
- Vectors just are 1-dimensional `Array`s
- Arrays are simply containers
- Therefore, vectors (and arrays) can store any type of object; for example:
    * Int, Float64, String
    * Array, Dict, Function
    * user-defined types

+++

Consider some simple vector objects:
```Julia
v = [4, 5, 6]

u = [4.2, 5.6, 7.6]

w = ["dog", "cat", "shoe"]
```

---

### 2.1.1 Initializing and Growing Vectors
```Julia
a = Int[]               # initialize empty vector of Ints

a2 = Vector{Int}()      # identical to above

a3 = Array{Int, 1}()    # also identical
```

+++


```julia
push!(a, 999)

push!(a, 1000)

append!(a, [4, 8, 15])  # appends vector to tail
```

---

### 2.1.2 Types Matter
Julia has a very explicit type system (more on this later), so some caution is required
```julia
v = [4, 5, 6]

push!(v, 3.14)     # Fails (Matlab casts all elements)
```

---

### 2.1.3 Pre-Allocating Vectors
- In general, it's preferable to pre-allocate your arrays
- Has performance implications
- Growing a vector in place is usually 2 operations versus 1 for assignment only
- Also has the advantage of forcing you to think more about your code
    * In a sense, it's self-documenting code

+++

```julia
x1 = zeros(4)               # default is Float64

x2 = zeros(Int, 10)

x3 = falses(5)

x4 = trues(4)
```

---

### 2.1.4 Indexing a Vector
- Identical to R's behavior
- Nearly identical to Matlab, but use `[` instead of `(`
- Note that Julia uses 1-based indexing

```julia
s = ["this", "is", "a string vector"]

s[2]                # gets second element

s[3] = "shoe"       # set third element to "shoe"

s[end]              # gets last element

s[end - 1]          # gets 2nd to last element
```

+++

Can also index with boolean values

```julia
v1 = [4, 5, 6]

v[[true, false, true]]      # gets first and third element
```

+++

This has advantages for doing equality and inequality comparisons
```julia
v2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]

keep_elem = v2 .> 6

v2[keep_elem]               # returns [7, 8]
```

---

### 2.1.5 Slicing and Subsetting Vectors
```julia
v = [5, 6, 7, 8]

v[1:2]              # gets first 2 elements

v[3:end]            # gets elements 3 and 4
```

+++

```julia
x = ["dog", "cat", "bird", "potato"]

animal_indcs = [1, 2, 3]

animals = x[animal_indcs]
```

---


### 2.1.6 Concatenating Vectors
```julia
x1 = [4, 5, 6]

x2 = [55, 66, 77]

x3 = [x1; x2]

x3b = vcat(x1, x2)          # same as above
```

---


### 2.2.1 Element-Wise Operations
Element-wise operations in Julia are performed using the `.` operator, which is often called the "broadcasting" operator.

```julia
a = [3, 4, 3, 6]

a .== 3

a .> 4
```

---

## 3 Matrices (2-D `Array`s)
Matrices in Julia are just 2-dimensional arrays, and have many of the same behaviors as vectors (i.e., 1-dimensional arrays)
```julia
a = zeros(5, 3)              # 5-by-3 matrix

a2 = Array{Float64}(5, 3)    # same as above

b = [2 3 4;
     5 6 7;
     4 9 1]                  # semi-colon denotes end of row  
```

---

### 3.1.1 Indexing and Slicing Matrices
```julia
a = randn(3, 3)       # matrix of random values from N(0, 1)

a[3, 1]               # gets element in third row first column

a[2, :]               # gets all of second row

a[:, 1]               # gets all of first column

a[:, 2] = 999.0       # assigns 999 to all of 2nd column
```

---

## 4 Reading and Writing Data to Files
The `readdlm()` and `writedlm()` function are used for reading and writing plain-text files in a delimited format. They are easy to use and flexible.

---


### 4.1.1 Using `readdlm()` and `writedlm()` for Plaintext
```julia
a = randn(100, 100)

writedlm("gaussian_mat.csv", a, ',')

a2 = readdlm("gaussian_mat.csv", ',')
```

---

### 4.1.2 JLD.jl Package for Binary Data Format
The JLD package can be used for saving objects from your Julia session in to binary objects, similar to HDF5.
```julia

using JLD

a = rand(10, 10)

b = [1,3]

save("myfile.jld", "a_mat", a)

d = load("myfile.jld")
```

+++

The JLD package can also save multiple objects in one call to `save()`
```julia
a = rand(10, 10)

b = [1,3]

save("myfile.jld", "a_mat", a, "b_vec", b)

d = load("myfile.jld")
```

---

### 5 Functions

Julia has many elements of a functional language. Functions are first-class citizens, and can be created by other functions and passed as arguments. Also note that the common practice is to write functions that don't modify their arguments. If you do write a function that modifies its arguments in place, the convention is to add `!` to the function name
### 5.1.1 Defining a function
```julia
function addone(n)
    res = n + 1
    return res
end
```

+++

```julia
addone(n) = n + 1

f(x) = 2x + Ï€ - 17
```

---

### 5.1.2 Passing Functions as Arguments
```julia
map(addone, [1, 2, 3])
```

---


## 5.2.1 Generic Programming and Adding Methods to Functions
```julia
function addtwo(x::Int)
    res = x + 2
    return res
end
```

+++

```julia
function addtwo(x::Array{Int, 1})
    n = lenght(x)
    y = zeros(Int, n)
    for i = 1:n
        y[i] = x[i] + 2
    end
    return y
end
```




---

## 6 Types
Julia has a very powerful type system, which allows you to construct your own types which will behave exactly like native types (e.g., Int, String) in terms of performance.

---

### 6.1.1 Defining Composite Types
We define types using the `type` keyword, and then list the components of that type.

```julia
type Person
    age
    sex
    height
    weight
end
joe = Person(27, "male", 6.0, 170)
```

+++

But we can do better. If we define the type and give the components themselves explicit types, the compiler will generate more efficient code.

```julia
type Person
    age::Int
    sex::String
    height::Float64
    weight::Int
end
```
